  <h2>Learning with Miyoshi</h2>
  The <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi" target="_blank">Learning with Miyoshi</a> repository has explanations of class grading and other explanations about categories and scoring.  If you are a student, make sure you are familiar with the scoring.

  <h2>Programming Projects</h2>
  You might have noticed that the programming projects links above all take you to the same spot.  This is because the introductory students and the AP Computer Science (APCS) students have choices on their projects and can choose to do many of the same projects.  This does not mean that APCS students should just redo their introductory projects using java.  I would suggest not doing that.  What it means is that students have a wide array of options to choose from.  And if there is something you would like to do that is not on the list of projects, talk to me about it.  I may or may not allow it, and it may or may not make the list for current and/or future students.
